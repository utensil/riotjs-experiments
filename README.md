# RiotJS Experiments

Try to experiment [RiotJS](https://github.com/muut/riotjs) with my preferred work flows.

## Current Progress

Currently, I've made RiotJS work with:

* [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl) (An implementation of [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) Architecture Pattern )
* ES6, specifically using [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
* [Jade](https://github.com/jadejs/jade)
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [NPM Scripts](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool)
* [Less](https://github.com/less/less.js)

## Plans

* Multi-page app
* Reorganize directory structure
* Skeleton generator
