# RiotJS Experiments

Try to experiment [RiotJS](https://github.com/muut/riotjs) with my preferred workflows.

## Current Progress

Currently, I've made RiotJS work with:

* [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl) (An implemenation of [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) Architecture Pattern )
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* ES6, specifically using [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
* [Jade](https://github.com/jadejs/jade)

## Plans

* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
* [Less](https://github.com/less/less.js)
* Multi-page app

## Helpful references
